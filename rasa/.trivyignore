CVE-2020-15266

# Python websockets 8.0.2
#
# The aaugustin websockets library before 9.1 for Python has an
# Observable Timing Discrepancy on servers when HTTP Basic Authentication
# is enabled with basic_auth_protocol_factory(credentials=...).
# An attacker may be able to guess a password via a timing attack.
#
# We need to update websockets to version 9.1 to fix CVE-2021-33880 when
# we drop support for Python 3.6.
#
# We can't do this right now because websockets 9.1 requires sanic >= 21
# which requires dropping support for python 3.6.
