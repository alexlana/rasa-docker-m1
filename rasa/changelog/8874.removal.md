Specifying the `retrieve_events_from_previous_conversation_sessions` kwarg for the any `TrackerStore` was deprecated and has now been removed.
Please use the `retrieve_full_tracker()` method instead.

Deserialization of pickled trackers was deprecated and has now been removed.
Rasa will perform any future save operations of trackers using json serialisation.

Removed catch for missing (deprecated) `session_date` when saving trackers in `DynamoTrackerStore`.
