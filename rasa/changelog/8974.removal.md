Intent IDs sent with events (to kafka and elsewhere) have been removed, intent
names can be used instead (or if numerical values are needed for backwards
compatibility, one can also hash the names to get previous ID values, ie.
`hash(intent_name)` is the old ID values). Intent IDs have been removed because
they were providing no extra value and integers that large were problematic for
some event broker implementations.
