Bump TensorFlow version to 2.6.

  This update brings some security benefits (see TensorFlow 
  [release notes](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.6.0)
  for details). However, internal experiments suggest that it is also associated with
  increased train and inference time, as well as increased memory usage.

  You can read more about why we decided to update TensorFlow, and what the expected 
  impact is [here](https://rasa.com/blog/let-s-talk-about-tensorflow-2-6/).

  If you experience a significant increase in train time, inference time, and/or memory 
  usage, please let us know in the [forum](https://forum.rasa.com/t/feedback-upgrading-to-tensorflow-2-6/48331).

  Users can no longer set `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS=1` if they are using GPU(s) because a 
  `tf.errors.UnimplementedError` will be thrown by TensorFlow (read more
  [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.6.0)).

  This **breaks backward compatibility of previously trained models**.
  It is not possible to load models trained with previous versions of Rasa Open Source. Please re-train
