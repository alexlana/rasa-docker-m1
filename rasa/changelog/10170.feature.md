A new experimental feature called `Markers` has been added.
`Markers` allow you to define points of interest in conversations as a set of conditions that need to be met.
A new command `rasa evaluate markers` allows you to apply these conditions to your existing tracker stores 
and outputs the points at which the conditions were satisfied.
