1) Failed test stories will display full retrieval intents. 

2) Retrieval intents will be extracted during action prediction in test stories so that we won't have unnecessary mismatches anymore.

Let's take this example story:
```yaml
- story: test story
  steps:
  - user: |
      what is your name?
    intent: chitchat/ask_name
  - action: utter_chitchat/ask_name
  - intent: bye
  - action: utter_bye
```

Before:
```yaml
  steps:
  - intent: chitchat   # 1) intent is not displayed in it's original form
  - action: utter_chitchat/ask_name  # predicted: utter_chitchat  
                  # 2) retrieval intent is not extracted during action prediction and we have a mismatch
  
  - intent: bye  # some other fail
  - action: utter_bye # some other fail
```

Both 1) and 2) problems are solved.

Now:
```yaml
  steps:
  - intent: chitchat/ask_name
  - action: utter_chitchat/ask_name
  - intent: bye  # some other fail
  - action: utter_bye # some other fail
```
