The naming scheme for trained models was changed. Unless you provide a 
`--fixed-model-name` to `rasa train`, Rasa Open Source will now generate a new model
name using the schema `<timestamp>-<random name>.tar.gz`, e.g. 
- `20211018-094821-composite-pita.tar.gz` (for a model containing a trained NLU and dialogue model)
- `nlu-20211018-094821-composite-pita.tar.gz` (for a model containing only a trained NLU model but not a dialogue model)
- `core-20211018-094821-composite-pita.tar.gz` (for a model containing only a trained dialogue model but no NLU model)
