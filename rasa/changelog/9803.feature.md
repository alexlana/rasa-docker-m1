Rasa Open Source now uses the [model configuration](model-configuration.mdx) to build a

[directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).
This graph describes the dependencies between the items in your model configuration and
how data flows between them. This has two major benefits:

- Rasa Open Source can use the computational graph to optimize the execution of your
  model. Examples for this are efficient caching of training steps or executing
  independent steps in parallel.
- Rasa Open Source can represent different model architectures flexibly. As long as the
  graph remains acyclic Rasa Open Source can in theory pass any data to any graph
  component based on the model configuration without having to tie the underlying
  software architecture to the used model architecture.

This change required changes to custom policies and custom NLU components. See the
documentation for a detailed 
[migration guide](migration-guide.mdx#custom-policies-and-custom-components).
