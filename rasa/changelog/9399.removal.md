`weight_sparsity` has been removed. Developers should replace it with `connection_density` in the following way: `connection_density` = 1-`weight_sparsity`.

`softmax` is not available as a `loss_type` anymore.

The `linear_norm` option has been removed as possible value for `model_confidence`. Please, use `softmax` instead.

`minibatch` has been removed as a value for `tensorboard_log_level`, use `batch` instead. 

Removed deprecation warnings related to the removed component config values.
