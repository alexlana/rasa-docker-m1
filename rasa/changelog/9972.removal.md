Removed slot auto-fill functionality, making the key invalid to use in the domain file.
The `auto_fill` parameter was also removed from the constructor of the `Slot` class.
In order to continue filling slots with entities of the same name, you now have to define a `from_entity` mapping in the `slots` section of the domain.
