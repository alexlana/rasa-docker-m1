Added explicit mechanism for slot filling that allows slots to be set and/or updated throughout the conversation. 
This mechanism is enabled by defining global slot mappings in the `slots` section of the domain file.

In order to support this new functionality, implemented a new default action: `action_extract_slots`. This new action runs after each user turn and checks if any slots can be filled with information extracted from the last user message based on defined slot mappings.

Since slot mappings were moved away from the `forms` section of the domain file, converted the form's `required_slots` to a list of slot names.
In order to restrict certain mappings to a form, you can now use the `conditions` key in the mapping to define the applicable `active_loop`, like so:
```yaml
slots:
  location:
    type: text
    influence_conversation: false
    mappings:
    - type: from_entity
      entity: city
      conditions:
      - active_loop: booking_form
```
