Updated documentation publishing mechanisms to build one version of [the documentation](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa)
for each major version of Rasa Open Source, starting from 2.x upwards. Previously, we were building one
version of the documentation for each minor version of Rasa Open Source, resulting in a poor user
experience and high maintenance costs.
